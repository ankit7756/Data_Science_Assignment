## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **data-driven property investment recommendation system** for districts in **South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, UK**.  
The goal was to **analyze multiple real-world datasets**, clean and preprocess them, perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and finally **recommend the best districts** to live or invest in based on several socio-economic factors.

The project demonstrates **practical applications of data science for decision-making**, including **data cleaning, visualization, normalization, and scoring**, resulting in a **final recommendation system**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and integrate multiple datasets related to housing, crime, population, broadband, and school performance.  
- Clean, preprocess, and handle missing data to ensure **data quality**.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, distributions, and correlations.  
- Develop a **Recommendation System** that evaluates districts based on:  
  - 🏠 **House Prices** (affordability)  
  - 📶 **Broadband Speed** (connectivity)  
  - 🚔 **Crime Rates** (safety)  
  - 🏫 **School Attainment 8 Scores** (quality of education)  
  - 👥 **Population Size** (livability context)  
- Create **visualizations and scoring metrics** to identify **Highly Recommended, Recommended, and Not Recommended** districts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`Cleaned_Data/`** → All processed and cleaned datasets ready for analysis.  
- **`Code/`** → R scripts for data cleaning, EDA, modeling, and recommendations.  
- **`Visualizations/`** → Charts and graphs used in the analysis and report.  
- **`Report/`** → Final academic report for submission.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Barnsley, Wakefield, and Doncaster** were ranked **Highly Recommended** due to their **affordability, moderate crime rates, and balanced livability**.  
- **Leeds and Bradford** were **Not Recommended** mainly because of **higher crime rates and housing costs**, despite excellent broadband and large urban amenities.  
- The **Recommendation System** combines **5 normalized metrics** into a single **0–10 rating scale** for easy comparison.  
- A **final bar chart** visually presents the **district livability scores** for investors and residents.
